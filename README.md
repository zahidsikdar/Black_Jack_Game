Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played in casinos and among friends. The goal of the game is to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21. Here's a summary of the rules:

**Objective:**
The main objective of blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

**Card Values:**
- Number cards (2-10): Face value
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): 10 points each
- Ace: 1 point or 11 points, depending on what benefits the player's hand more

**Gameplay:**
1. Players place their bets before the game begins.
2. Each player and the dealer are dealt two cards. Players' cards are usually dealt face-up, while the dealer has one card face-up (known as the "upcard") and one face-down (known as the "hole card").
3. Players can choose from several options:

   - **Hit:** Request an additional card to increase their hand's total value.
   - **Stand:** Keep their current hand without requesting more cards.
   - **Double Down:** Double the original bet and receive one more card, after which they must stand.
   - **Split:** If the first two cards are of equal value, the player can split them into two separate hands, each with its own bet.
   - **Surrender:** Some casinos offer the option to surrender, forfeiting half of the bet and ending the hand.

4. Players continue to take actions until they decide to stand or their hand exceeds 21, resulting in a "bust." If a player busts, they lose their bet.
5. Once all players have completed their actions, the dealer reveals their hole card.
6. The dealer must hit until their hand value is 17 or higher. Some casinos have variations on this rule.
7. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.
8. If the dealer does not bust, the player's hands are compared to the dealer's hand. Players with higher hand values than the dealer's without busting win and are paid even money on their bets.
9. If a player has blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card) and the dealer doesn't have blackjack, the player is usually paid at a higher rate (e.g., 3:2).

**Winning:**
- If the player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21, the player wins.
- If the dealer's hand exceeds 21 and the player's hand is still in play (not bust), the player wins.
- If the player's hand exceeds 21, they lose regardless of the dealer's hand.
- If the player and dealer have the same hand value, it's a "push," and the player's bet is returned.

Remember that specific rules can vary between different casinos and blackjack variants, so it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the rules of the specific game you're playing.
